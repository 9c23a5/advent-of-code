# Advent of Code

## Goals of this repository

1. Learn how to write code in a more Rubyst way

2. Improve my problem-solving skills

3. Practice writing tests from zero, and possibly before writing any code

4. Prepare a GitHub CI pipeline

## Directory hierarchy

This repository aims to solve every AoC on every year therefore I decided on the following hierarchy:

```
advent-of-code
└── 2015
    └── day01
        ├── day_01.rb
        ├── day_01_spec.rb
        └── input.txt
```

- `day_01.rb`: Solution for the puzzle

- `day_01_spec.rb`: RSpec file for the solution itself, using the examples on the puzzles description

- `input.txt`: Raw input for my own puzzle. This will be different depending on the account you are logged in on AoC website
